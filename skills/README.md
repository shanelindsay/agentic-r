# Scientific Skills

This directory aggregates scientific skill cards that complement the lexical decision R workflow:

- `scientific-thinking/`: high-level scientific reasoning skills (literature review, hypothesis generation, exploratory analysis, visualization, writing, peer review, etc.).
  - Includes document-format subskills for PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX automation.
  - Content sourced from K-Dense AI’s Claude Scientific Skills project (MIT licensed).

Each skill directory contains an `SKILL.md` overview plus supporting references. See `scientific-thinking/LICENSE.md` for licensing terms and individual subfolders for any additional notices.
