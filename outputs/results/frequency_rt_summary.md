# Frequency and response time

- Trials analysed: 99138 (subjects: 29; characters: 3852)
- Median stroke count held constant in effect estimates: 9

Frequency effect (holding stroke count at the median):

- Moving from the 10th to 50th percentile of frequency is associated with a 83.7 ms faster response.
- Moving from the 50th to 90th percentile yields a further 32.3 ms reduction.
- Between the 90th and 99th percentile the model shows only a 8.4 ms increase, indicating a flat or slightly reversing trend at the very high end.

Overall, characters in the 99th percentile respond about 14.6% faster than those in the 10th percentile.
