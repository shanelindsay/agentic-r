# Rise of Open Science in Chinese Psychology

## Overview

Open science has gained traction in mainland China as psychologists respond to global reproducibility concerns and domestic mandates for transparent, high-quality research. Early adopters translated international debates on replication and preregistration into Mandarin resources, while policy reforms signalled national support for data sharing and responsible research conduct. The result is a steadily expanding ecosystem that links government directives, funding incentives, scholarly communities, and training pipelines that encourage Chinese psychologists to adopt open practices.

## Key Milestones

- **2010s replication debates.** Coverage of the Open Science Collaboration (2015) findings in mainland outlets introduced many Chinese researchers to preregistration and shared repositories, prompting informal discussion groups within major psychology departments.
- **2018 policy turning point.** The State Council issued the *Opinions on Strengthening the Preservation and Open Sharing of Scientific Data*, which established expectations for data stewardship across public science projects and legitimised conversations about openness in psychology labs.
- **2018 formation of the Chinese Open Science Network (COSN).** Psychologists from Beijing Normal University, Sun Yat-sen University, and other institutions launched COSN to localise training materials, host webinars, and translate frameworks such as the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines.
- **2019–2021 funding incentives.** The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) expanded grant guidelines that require data management plans and encourage deposition of behavioural datasets, embedding open science checkpoints into review criteria.
- **2021–present registered report pilots.** Journals including *Acta Psychologica Sinica* and *Advances in Psychological Science* began piloting registered report tracks with support from the Chinese Psychological Society (CPS), normalising preregistered peer review for domestic authors.

## Institutional Drivers

### Government policy

Chinese psychologists operate within a national policy environment that increasingly treats scientific data as a strategic asset. The 2018 State Council directive mandated cataloguing and open release of government-funded data except in sensitive domains, laying the groundwork for repositories that social and behavioural scientists can use. Complementary rules from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) require institutions to build data platforms, provide metadata standards, and evaluate compliance during project acceptance. Because psychology projects frequently involve human participants, institutional review boards (IRBs) now balance privacy safeguards with transparency requirements, leading to protocols for anonymisation and controlled-access sharing.

### Funding agencies

NSFC and provincial foundations have linked grant success to transparent workflows. Application forms now request information on preregistration plans, data documentation strategies, and repository destinations. Post-award inspections examine whether investigators uploaded code and stimuli to national platforms such as the Science and Technology Resource Sharing Service Platform. Funding calls in developmental and educational psychology explicitly flag replication studies and secondary analysis proposals as priority areas, signalling to early-career scholars that open science practices can be career-enhancing rather than risky.

### Professional societies and universities

Professional bodies have created governance structures to monitor progress. CPS convened an Open Science Committee that disseminates model policies for laboratories, organises summer institutes on reproducible methods, and recognises departments that meet openness benchmarks. Universities including Peking University, Zhejiang University, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) host reproducibility task forces that run carpentries-style workshops on version control, dynamic reporting with R Markdown or Quarto, and ethical data sharing. Graduate curricula increasingly incorporate modules on preregistration, registered reports, and responsible conduct of research in digital environments.

## Research Practices in Transition

### Preregistration and registered reports

Mandarin-language templates on the Open Science Framework (OSF) and locally hosted registries have lowered barriers to preregistration for laboratory and field studies. Early adopters share exemplary protocols through COSN webinars, while journal pilot programs reward authors with in-principle acceptance and highlighted badges for transparency. Collaborative replication initiatives—such as multisite studies on social cognition and educational interventions—now routinely preregister hypotheses and analysis plans, demonstrating feasibility within Chinese regulatory contexts.

### Data and code sharing infrastructure

Psychology teams leverage a mix of global and domestic repositories. OSF remains popular for its integration with preregistration, but national platforms like the Science Data Bank (ScienceDB) and the National Open Science Cloud (NOSC) provide storage that satisfies domestic cybersecurity regulations. Institutions supply bilingual data dictionaries, script annotations, and README templates to help students deposit usable materials. Increasingly, research groups adopt version control (Git) and literate programming (R Markdown, Quarto) to produce audit trails compatible with funder audits and journal requirements.

### Training and community building

Open science practices spread via peer-led instruction. COSN and CPS co-host annual reproducibility forums, featuring case studies on transparent research in developmental, clinical, and industrial-organisational psychology. Student-led reproducibility clubs at Beijing Normal University and East China Normal University offer mentorship on data cleaning, preprint preparation, and sharing sensitive data responsibly. International collaborations, including joint workshops with the Center for Open Science and the UK Reproducibility Network, provide templates for adapting best practices to Chinese regulatory and cultural contexts.

## Remaining Challenges

Despite rapid progress, obstacles remain. Incentive structures still prioritise publication counts in Chinese core journals, making time-intensive replication and curation work harder to justify. Data privacy regulations can limit open sharing of sensitive participant information, requiring controlled access mechanisms that some repositories lack. Furthermore, uneven resource distribution means that institutions outside major urban centres may struggle to provide training or infrastructure. Addressing these gaps will require sustained investment, clearer recognition of open science contributions in promotion criteria, and continued dialogue between policymakers and frontline researchers.

## Future Directions

Chinese psychology is poised to deepen its engagement with open science by expanding registered report options, integrating reproducibility metrics into promotion and tenure reviews, and nurturing cross-laboratory replication networks. Aligning domestic repositories with international metadata standards will make Chinese datasets more discoverable, supporting global research syntheses. Continued translation of training materials, coupled with mentorship for early-career scholars, will help ensure that transparent, collaborative workflows become the default for behavioural science across the country.
