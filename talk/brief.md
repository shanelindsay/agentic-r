Dear Dr. Lindsay,

Following my call with Prof. Liang earlier today, there is one talk invitation about you:

She would like to invite you to give an around 40-minute talk at their forum, either on AI & Clinical Linguistics or on an AI-informed, clinically oriented psychology/neuroscience topic. The assumption on their side is that the format would be online. The date of the Forum is 07.11.2025- 09.11.2025.

If you are willing to have the talk, I’ll then revert to Prof. Liang and coordinate the logistics.

Best wishes,
Yumeng

Here’s a clean English translation. I’ve kept the structure and key terms faithful to the original.

# 2025 Nanjing Normal University Doctoral and Master’s Forum on Language Development and Disorders (First Circular)

## Forum overview

Since 2018, our university has successfully held a series of summer schools and innovation forums centred on research and application in clinical linguistics, earning wide praise and strong recognition from postgraduate students and early-career scholars in China and abroad. In recent years, under the impetus of artificial intelligence, research on language development and disorders has been shifting towards digital and intelligent paradigms. AI not only provides innovative tools for first-language acquisition and second-language teaching, it also shows irreplaceable value in early screening and precise diagnosis of language disorders and in barrier-free communication for people with language impairments.

To accelerate deep integration between AI technologies and language-health services, and to promote an intelligent dissemination system for Chinese language and culture, the “2025 Nanjing Normal University Doctoral and Master’s Forum on Language Development and Disorders,” hosted by the School of Chinese Language and Literature at Nanjing Normal University, organised by the University’s Research Centre for Language Development and Disorders, and co-organised by the School of International Cultural Education and the Neurolinguistics Branch of the Chinese Association for the Modernisation of the Chinese Language, is scheduled to take place in the ancient capital of Nanjing from 7 to 9 November 2025.

This forum focuses on frontier topics in language development and disorders, integrating perspectives across linguistics, medicine, and artificial intelligence. It will be organised around three themes: “Frontier, Intelligence, Service.” The organising committee warmly welcomes PhD and Master’s students engaged in research on language development and disorders, including those in linguistics, neuroscience, rehabilitation medicine, AI and related disciplines.

Most likely you mean **Prof. Dandan Liang (梁丹丹)** at **Nanjing Normal University** rather than Nanjing University. She is a professor and doctoral supervisor in the School of Chinese Language and Literature, widely described as working in **clinical linguistics/neurolinguistics** with a focus on **language development and disorders** including autism, developmental dyslexia and aphasia. She also convenes the recurring “Language Development and Disorders” postgraduate forum at NNU. ([news.njnu.edu.cn][1])

**Key pointers**

* Affiliation: School of Chinese Language and Literature, Nanjing Normal University; professor and PhD supervisor; Vice Dean in some reports. ([PubMed][2])
* Topic fit: Talks and news items consistently present her work as clinical linguistics and developmental language research. ([nau.edu.cn][3])
* Recent publication listing her NNU affiliation in a developmental language study. ([PubMed][2])

**How to reach her**

* Corresponding-author email used on a ChinaXiv preprint: **[ldd233@163.com](mailto:ldd233@163.com)**. ([ChinaXiv][4])
* College office site for general enquiries: NNU College of Chinese Language & Literature. ([360教育在线][5])

If you actually meant **Nanjing University (NJU)**, I cannot find a female Prof. Liang in **clinical linguistics** there; the clinical/developmental linguistics profile matches Prof. **Dandan Liang** at **Nanjing Normal University**. Want me to draft a short introductory email in English and Chinese?
